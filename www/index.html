            <p>Leave the car park and turn left along Bridgegate, towards the Packhorse Bridge and the town centre. 
			A few yards along Bridgegate, before you arrive at the bridge you will see a plaque on the wall, on the right, 
			which marks the old boundary between the ancient townships of Heptonstall and Wadsworth.</p>
			<p>Heptonstall is a village on top of the hill high above Hebden Bridge, but its boundary once extended down 
			to this point and Wadsworth (which is now a civil parish), is also high above Hebden Bridge on an opposing hillside, 
			whose boundary still extends to Hebden Bridge.</p>
			<p>The old packhorse route from Halifax to Burnley was mainly on hilltops, but came down to the valley bottom here 
			from Heptonstall to pass over this bridge and then ascend to Wadsworth. 
			Hebden Bridge was originally just a hamlet based on the wool trade.</p>
			<p>When waterpower was needed to industrialise weaving, Hebden Bridge soon had powered mills, as here there is water 
			and steep valley sides in abundance. 
			By the 1800s, the industry changed to cotton, especially a kind of strong cotton cloth known as fustian.</p>
			<p>Fustian (of which velveteen, corduroy and moleskin are well known examples) is used mainly in menswear. 
			The cloth, woven in strips about 32 inches wide, is changed in appearance by many later processes, the main 
			one of which was having the wefts manually cut (Fustian Cutting) - an extremely laborious process.</p>
			<p>Fustian cutting was first adopted here as a trade in the late 18th century, and remained a hand process through 
			the second half of the 19th century.  Hebden Bridge became known as 'Trouser Town' (or sometimes Fustianopolis).</p>

            <p>Two inscription stones built into the bridge indicate that there were repairs to the bridge in 1602 and 1657. 
			The first arch was covered by buildings until 1977.  It covers what was an outflow of a Bridge Mill waterwheel 
			and was never a span over the river.</p>
			<p>There are four alcoves on the bridge that allowed people crossing the bridge to stand back to let the horses pass.  
			The third arch in the bridge is an overflow arch to help prevent flooding.</p>
			<p>Over the bridge on your right, you will find the 'Hole in the Wall' public house, dating from 1899, 
			but the site of a number of previous public houses.  
			It is thought that the name derives from cannon-shot damage during the English Civil War.</p>

			when he bought the land to build the houses.  
			He was Minister of Wainsgate Chapel in 1764.</p>
			<p>He was offered a position in London, but after packing to leave was so moved by local people's affection 
			that he changed his mind and stayed here as minister of the  Ebenezer Chapel, which we will see later.</p>
			<p>The first 3 houses were built about 1804 for Rev Fawcett and his family to live in when he retired in 1805 
			(it is thought that he lived in No 12) and he wanted to be buried in a family vault on the hillside behind 
			(hence the name of the area) but an increased demand for buildings meant that he was buried at Wainsgate Chapel.</p>
			<p>It is thought that the first house was later altered by the addition of many windows to make the top two floors 
			into Fustian Cutters' workshops - where they sheared cloth with special knives to give it a corduroy 
			feel - hence the need for lots of windows giving as much light as possible.</p>
